                <p>How about we get you setup with your media in the settings section.</p>
                <p>There you'll be able to point Shadowcaster to your movies, tv shows, music,
                    and pictures. You can select which encoding you would like your movies to be in
                    and whether or not you'd like the encoding to be permanent or just on-the-fly.
